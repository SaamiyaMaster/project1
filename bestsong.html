			<h3> Favorite song at the moment: </h3>
			<p> The song is called 'Monster' by EXO, it is about a toxic love story. </p>
			<p> EXO are singing this song in First Person POV in order to highlight the thought process of toxic lover </p>
			<p> Other fans spectate that this music video hints at their Lore/Storyline.</p>
			<p> I believe the song serves as both! I love the music video, the vocals, and the choreography! </p>
